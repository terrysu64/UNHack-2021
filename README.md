# UNHack-2021

This project is the York University's UNHack SDG Sustainability goals.

The project deals with the woes and challenges teens and youth in general face when looking for job opportunities.

A root to this issue is the lack of a currently existing platform tailored towards this niche of youth (High school to first-year university) students. 

Hence, to tackle this persisting issue, we are creating a system that allows one to search for co-op/part-time job opportunities tailored for younger teens. Often, from our experience, when looking for a job, they will all say "Level of study: undergraduate,"
or "First-Year (university)." Which makes the pursual of a job quite discouraging. 

With this system, we can help students like us find work and opportunities
for students like us. Something that is already quite scarce in Canada in contrast to countries like the USA and UK where students gain countless job/co-op opportunities
intangible to the average high school student. Such as interning on Wall Street, working for NASA, interning in BPL Clubs, or everyday jobs like cutting grass, 
shovelling snow, and more.

To further the purpose of our program, we have also implemented a mentee-mentor platform for people who are interested in different fields of study. Ultimately, this
would eliminate the need for seasonal and rare webinars that happen once or twice a year for students who would like to interact with industry professionals or university students. This system would allow these industry professionals and university students to join and be readily accessible almost anytime to answer young teens' 
questions regarding experience, work/co-op opportunities and most importantly, build a network that will suit them for their future endeavours. In addition, this networking aspect
will allow students to gain a one-to-one connection with their mentors in contrast to industry webinars where the speakers will never know who you are.

All in all, if we synthesize these aspects, we can formulate a system that allows us to not only connect students with work/co-op opportunities during a ravaging
COVID-19 pandemic; but also ensure that students get the guidance they need and build genuine, strong, and the right connections too. To better prepare today's
youth for tomorrow because creating a better today allows for a better tomorrow.
